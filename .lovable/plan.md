# Remove White Background from Veyl Avatar

## What
Process `src/assets/veyl-avatar.png` to remove all remaining white background, leaving only Veyl's form with full transparency. This ensures the comic panel in VeylStage shows just her silhouette against the cyberpunk alley backdrop with zero white edges or artifacts.

## Steps
1. Re-process `src/assets/veyl-avatar.png` — aggressively remove all white and near-white pixels from the background, preserving only Veyl's character form with a transparent PNG background.
2. Clean up any white fringing or halo artifacts around her edges for a seamless composite over the dark alley scene.

## Result
Veyl stands cleanly in her comic panel with the neon-green glowing border, no white rectangle or edges visible — just glowing robot mommy in Maggie's alley.
